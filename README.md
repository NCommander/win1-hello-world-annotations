# An annotated version of Windows 1.0's Hello World SDK sample, showing 35 years of technological development.

As part of a research project, I wanted to document Windows 1.0 infamous HELLO.C, whcih was 125 lines of code long and note how Windows has infact evolved over the last 35 years. It is infact possible to compile this sample on Windows 1.0 and run it on Windows 10 32-bit (tested on 1909). I'll post a link to YouTube when it goes up.
